# gosh-lang
A simple programming language that is Turing complete. Why Gosh? IDK... it was impulsive...

You'll be saying "gosh" everytime you use this language, because:
- It's so simple
- It's simultaneously terrible coz it's written by a CS undergrad. Sorry.
- Might be useful for teaching beginners how to program???

Yea plz chuck me suggestions because I may or may not totally "botch" this. Maybe that would be a more suitable name...
Enjoy, and don't forget to star! :D
